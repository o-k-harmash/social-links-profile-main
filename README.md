## ðŸ”§ My Process

### âœ… Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- SEO with `<meta>` tags and other metadata
- CSS with cascade and inheritance
- CSS variables
- Relative data units
- Flexbox layout
- Minimal class usage â€” tag-based styling where appropriate

---

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

I deepened my understanding of:

- **Semantic HTML5**: Using meaningful tags and clean structure
- **Custom attributes**: Including `data-*` attributes when needed
- **CSS cascade and inheritance**: Applying styles thoughtfully using the cascade and specificity
- **Efficient selector usage**: Combining selectors and using combinators instead of over-classing
- **Text wrapping in flex children**: When using `white-space: nowrap` or similar styles inside an element thatâ€™s nested in a flex item, the flex child must have an explicit `min-width` (e.g. `min-width: 0`) to allow proper shrinkage. Without it, long inline content can break layout constraints and prevent truncation or wrapping from working as expected.
- **Font sizing issues in `inline-flex`**: Elements using `display: inline-flex` may not always respect inherited `font-size` and `line-height`, leading to inconsistent typography unless these values are explicitly defined.

I also focused on building a structure thatâ€™s both **logical** and **scalable**, avoiding unnecessary classes when tag-based styling suffices.

### ðŸš€ Continued Development

I plan to build on these core concepts and use them as a solid foundation for more advanced layouts and components. Future learning will expand into accessibility (a11y), reusable design systems, and responsiveness using modern CSS tools like `grid`, `clamp()`, and container queries.
